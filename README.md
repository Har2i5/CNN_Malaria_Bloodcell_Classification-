# Malaria Cell Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify blood cells as either parasitized or uninfected using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of cell images and evaluates its performance on unseen data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Cell Images for Detecting Malaria**. It contains images of blood cells labeled as either "parasitized" or "uninfected."

## Source:

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **95%** on the test dataset. This performance demonstrates the model's ability to effectively classify blood cells as either parasitized or uninfected.
